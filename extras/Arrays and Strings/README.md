# Arrays and Strings
###### This section covers basic arrays and strings concepts - 

- An **array** is a basic data structure to store a collection of elements sequentially. These elements, however, can be accessed randomly via index values of the elements in arrays.
- Arrays can have one (linear) or more dimensions
- Index values start from 0
- An array has a fixed capacity, need to specify size during intialization - difficult to initialise
- Use of **dynamic arrays** - arrays with variable size
- In a 2D array, the elements are laid out in a rectangular grid, rather than a line
- In some programming languages, multidimensional arrays are represented as one dimensional arrays, and in others, the concept of multidimensional arrays does not exist.
- C++ - 2D arrays are stored as 1D arrays - A[i][j] equals to A[i * N + j] if we defined A as a one dimensional array which also contains M * N elements.
- Java: Two dimensional array is actually a one dimensional array which contains M elements, each of which is an array of N integers.
